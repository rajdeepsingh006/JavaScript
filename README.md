Hello Everyone

This is the Javascript code in which we have created a program that will create a NFT collection.
Firstly, we have created a variable that will store all the basic information of the NFT.The created variable is basically an array that will store information of multiple NFT's.
Then we have created a mintNFT function that will take the information of the nft from the user through its parameters namely _name, _sunglasses, _shirtType and _accessories. 
Inside this function we have created an object named as NFT that will store the metadata of the nft given by the user.
NFTs.push(NFT) will push the object into the variable NFTs.
After that the function will print the message that nft is minted with its name.
The function listNFTs() will print the metadata of all the nft's onto the screen including their id,name,Accessories etc.
Atlast,The function getTotalSupply() will print the total number of nft's present in the variable NFTs.
